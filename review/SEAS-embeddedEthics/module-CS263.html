                      "This course explores practical attacks on modern computer systems, explaining how those attacks
                      can be mitigated using careful system design and the judicious application of cryptography. The
                      course discusses topics like buffer overflows, web security, information flow control, and
                      anonymous communication mechanisms like Tor. The course includes several small projects which give
                      students hands-on experience with various offensive and defensive techniques; the final, larger
                      project is open-ended and driven by student interests."

                        Module Overview:
                      </strong>
                      In this module, we consider whether it is ethically acceptable for cybersecurity professionals to
                      “hack back” when the software systems they defend are targeted by cyberattacks. We begin by
                      discussing a recent real-world case of hacking back – Facebook’s 2011 response to persistent
                      cyberattacks conducted by the “Koobface Gang.” With this case study as a focal point, students
                      consider how various ways in which a cybersecurity team might respond to an attack (including by
                      hacking back) are likely to affect the rights and interests of all parties concerned. We then
                      discuss a number of prominent arguments for and against the claim that hacking back is in general
                      ethically acceptable. Each argument represents a different position about how cybersecurity
                      professionals should balance competing rights and interests as they decide whether hacking back is
                      an ethically acceptable option.

                        Connection to Course Technical Material:
                      </strong>
                      This course focuses on teaching students how to mitigate the effects of cyberattacks using passive
                      defensive strategies that protect sensitive systems and data by making them more difficult to
                      compromise in the first place. To develop a practical understanding of how modern cyberattacks
                      work, students learn how to conduct such attacks themselves, employing the same offensive
                      techniques as malicious attackers. While the course teaches students these techniques so that they
                      can better “harden” systems against them, the techniques can also be used offensively, to “hack
                      back” in response to a cyberattack. This module explores whether – and if so, when – these
                      techniques should be used offensively by cybersecurity professionals. In so doing, the module
                      helps students to better understand what is at stake, from an ethical point of view, in how
                      cybersecurity professionals respond to cyberattacks, and puts them in a better position to
                      ethically evaluate possible responses in real-world decision-making contexts.

                      The topic for this module was selected using a strategy that we often employ. First, in
                      consultation with the professor for the course, we come up with a list of interesting real-world
                      applications for the technical material covered in class: concrete problems that working computer
                      scientists are currently drawing on that material to solve. Second, we search for recent articles
                      and papers about those applications, trying to identify ethical debates that might make good
                      topics for the module. Third, we try to identify concepts, theories, and arguments from the
                      philosophical literature that (a) help shed light on those ethical debates and (b) are simple
                      enough to cover adequately in the context of a single class session. The third step is often the
                      trickiest, but in some cases is as easy as finding the right philosophical reading. A significant
                      portion of the philosophical content for this module, for instance, came from an
                      introductory-level piece by Patrick Lin (see “Assigned Readings” below).

                        Familiarize students with contemporary debates about whether corporations should be allowed to
                        “hack back” in response to cyberattacks.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Teach students to ethically evaluate possible courses of action that cybersecurity professionals
                        might take in response to a cyberattack (including hacking back) by considering how available
                        responses might affect the rights and interests of different groups of stakeholders.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Help students to understand that, in many cases, determining which possible response(s) to a
                        cyberattack would be ethically acceptable requires determining how competing rights and
                        interests ought to be balanced.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Introduce students to philosophical arguments that take different stances on whether hacking
                        back (in general) strikes an ethically acceptable balance among competing rights and interests.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Help students critically evaluate these arguments by considering whether they yield plausible
                        results when applied to realistic case studies.

                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Under what conditions, if any, is it morally permissible (or, less technically, ethically
                        acceptable) for cybersecurity professionals to hack back on behalf of the corporations they work
                        for?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        How might the decision to hack back (or not) affect the moral rights and morally significant
                        interests of different groups of stakeholders?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In cases where stakeholder rights and interests conflict, how should cybersecurity professionals
                        decide how to balance those competing rights and interests in responding to an attack?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Why do many commentators believe that hacking back is not just morally wrong, but obviously
                        morally wrong? (Are they right?)
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Why do some commentators reject this orthodox position, claiming that hacking back is not only
                        morally permissible, but should in fact be encouraged?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        How should cybersecurity professionals respond in cases where there is uncertainty concerning
                        who is responsible for an attack?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Is hacking back a form of vigilantism, self-defense, or neither? How should our answer to this
                        question affect our views about the moral permissibility of hacking back?
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Many people believe that it is morally permissible for the government to quarantine individuals
                        infected with highly contagious, life-threatening diseases without their consent. Is it,
                        similarly, morally permissible for companies to hack into “infected” third-party machines
                        controlled by cybercriminals, provided that doing so is necessary to prevent those machines from
                        being used in potentially devastating cyberattacks?

                        Sample Class Activity:
                      </strong>
                      The central case study for this module is the Facebook security team’s 2011 response to ongoing
                      cyberattacks on its systems and users perpetrated by the so-called “Koobface Gang,” a group of
                      cybercriminals operating out of St. Petersburg, Russia. After explaining the nature of these
                      cyberattacks and the offensive actions taken by Facebook’s security team in response, the Embedded
                      EthiCS TA leads students through a discussion of how the decision to hack back in similar cases
                      might affect the rights and interests of various stakeholder groups. Groups discussed include the
                      company being attacked (in this case, Facebook), the company’s userbase (Facebook users), third
                      parties not involved in the attack who might be inadvertently affected by an offensive response
                      against the alleged attackers, and other members of the public.

                      Group brainstorming activities like this one, which focus on helping students to explore the
                      ethical problems discussed in a module for themselves through the lens of real-world case studies,
                      both promote student engagement in the class discussion and help to make those ethical problems
                      more concrete. This module was taught for the first time in the fall of 2018, and students were
                      both highly engaged and made many illuminating contributions to the discussion (by their lights as
                      reported in student evaluations, and in the opinion of the TA).

                        Module Assignment:
                      </strong>
                      The follow-up assignment for this module is incorporated into a problemset in which students
                      attempt to use reverse engineering techniques learned in class to gain remote access to, and
                      exfiltrate data from, a simple email server. (This is, of course, only a simulated exercise!) The
                      final question of the problemset asks students to imagine that they are employees of a software
                      company, WidgetCo, whose intellectual property has been stolen by cyberattackers. In this
                      scenario, WidgetCo believes that the email server they have already compromised belongs to hackers
                      that have stolen its intellectual property, and wants the student identify a further vulnerability
                      that will allow them to erase all data stored on the server. WidgetCo claims that these actions
                      are morally justified in light of the initial attack, and in light of the fact that the hackers
                      appear to be planning a new attack on both WidgetCo and another company. Students are asked to
                      explain how they would respond to their employer’s request, and to provide a moral defense of
                      their response that appeals to arguments discussed in class or the readings.

                      This assignment was developed by the professor in consultation with the Embedded EthiCS TA.
                      Exercises like this one ask students to apply the philosophical material discussed in the module
                      to consider how they ought to act in a realistic employment scenarios featuring realistic computer
                      science problems. Including such assignments in Embedded EthiCS modules is important from a
                      pedagogical perspective, but they can be difficult for Embedded EthiCS TAs to construct without
                      assistance from computer scientists. Actively involving the professor (and/or the CS TAs) in the
                      construction of assignments is one effective way to address this challenge.

                        Lessons Learned:
                      </strong>
                      Student response to this module was overwhelmingly positive when it was taught in the fall of
                      2018. In follow-up evaluations, 92% of the class reported that the discussion was interesting, and
                      84% reported that the class helped them think more clearly about the moral issues we discussed.
                      Further, more than half of the class stayed behind once the session was over to continue the
                      discussion. Two lessons from our experience with this module are worth emphasizing:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Teaching this module has reinforced our view that Embedded EthiCS modules work best when they
                        are built around detailed, real-world case studies. Case studies of this kind help students to
                        immediately see the practical relevance of the moral issues and philosophical concepts we
                        discuss in the modules, and provide an effective way for us to make those issues and concepts
                        more concrete for students.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Approximately 25-30 students participated in the class session, making the class similar in size
                        to a large discussion section. We have found that longer full-class discussion and brainstorming
                        activities work well with groups of this size, and are an excellent way to promote student
                        engagement and participatory learning. In larger classes, it is often better to use shorter
                        activities in which students work together in small groups before reporting back to the full
                        class.
