                      “Networks—of social relationships, economic interdependencies, and digital interactions—are
                      critical in shaping our lives. This course introduces models and algorithms that help us
                      understand networks. Fundamental concepts from applied mathematics, microeconomics, and computer
                      science will be presented through the lens of network science, in order to equip students to
                      usefully analyze the “big data” generated by online networks. Applications discussed include the
                      viral spread of ideas, maximizing influence, and the contagion of economic downturns. Concepts and
                      tools covered include game theory, graph theory, data mining, and machine learning.”

                      </strong>
                      In this module, we discuss whether social media companies (such as Facebook) have a moral
                      obligation to suppress the spread of fake news over their networks. Students are introduced to
                      contemporary arguments for censoring fake news, as well as John Stuart Mill’s classic arguments
                      against censorship of any kind from On Liberty. Much of the discussion, as well as the follow-up
                      assignment, asks students to brainstorm specific strategies Facebook might use to suppress fake
                      news on its platform, and then evaluate those strategies from a moral perspective.

                        Connection to Course Technical Material:
                      </strong>
                      One thing students learn about in the course is influence cascade models (e.g. independent
                      cascade), which can be used to predict how information and influence will spread through a social
                      network. In one course exercise, students are asked to use such a model to predict whether a
                      hypothetical social media marketing campaign will "go viral." This module follows up on this
                      material, posing moral questions about how social media companies ought to use these tools in
                      designing their software platforms.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-4">
                    <p class="text-muted small">
                      We chose this topic because it allows us to connect material already being discussed in the course
                      (the use of network modeling tools to predict the spread of content on social media platforms)
                      with a contemporary social issue that is likely to resonate with students (the spread of political
                      "fake news" on social media in the lead-up to the 2016 Presidential election). However, many other
                      topics would be suitable for this course, in part because network modeling tools have practical
                      applications in a wide range of domains.

                      concepts in ethics. However, participating students tend to vary widely in their level of
                      familiarity with ethics, and may not be familiar with these concepts. We have found that
                      discussing them explicitly helps students better understand what is at stake in how we answer the
                      module’s central question about what Facebook is morally obligated to do, and how that question
                      relates to other, related questions (such as whether the law should allow Facebook and other

                      <i>On Liberty</i>
                      and provides the bulk of the
                      philosophical content for the module. In this chapter, Mill argues that censorship is virtually
                      always morally wrong, as a strict policy against censorship will produce more happiness in the
                      long run than any other policy. In addition to being powerful and highly accessible, Mill’s
                      arguments remain highly influential on contemporary discussions of censorship. Mill does not
                      explicitly address cases of deliberate misinformation in the reading, creating an opportunity for
                      students to interrogate Mill’s ideas as they apply to a contemporary (and for them, novel) problem
                      in computer ethics.

                      Presidential election. In the piece, the editorial board excoriated Facebook for failing to take a
                      more active role in suppressing political misinformation on its platform, and argued that it "owes
                      its users, and democracy itself, far more."

                      trusted, as they are likely to be infected by political bias. Rather than relying on these
                      organizations to judge the reliability of various news sources for us, the editorial suggests,
                      private citizens should instead work together to assess the reliability of particular stories for
                      themselves.

                      discussing these suggestions, students vote (via Google poll)
                      on whether Facebook should implement a few of the suggested strategies. The TA then briefly
                      reviews the results of the poll and asks volunteers to justify their answers.

                      The follow-up assignment asks students to write a short essay identifying a strategy for
                      suppressing fake news and defending a position about whether Facebook morally ought to implement
                      that strategy (drawing on material from the readings and in-class discussion).

                      Depending on the size of the class, this assignment could either be graded by the Embedded EthiCS
                      TA or graded pass/fail by the CS TAs.

                      The sample class activity asks students to identify concrete strategies Facebook might use to
                      suppress the spread of fake news. This assignment follows up on that activity, asking the students
                      to evaluate particular strategies from a moral perspective (drawing on the philosophical ideas
                      they learned in class). The assignment thus gives the students further practice applying moral
                      reasoning to a realistic software engineering problem, as well as practice articulating and
                      defending their own views about how that problem should be addressed.

                        Lessons Learned:
                      </strong>
                      Student response to this module was overwhelmingly positive both times it was taught (spring and
                      fall 2017). A few lessons stand out.

                      <li>
                        The topic of the module directly connects a social issue familiar to the students from recent
                        news coverage (the spread of fake news on social media platforms in the leadup to the 2016 U.S.
                        Presidential election) with specific technical material taught in the course (using network
                        modeling tools to predict the spread of content on social media platforms). As a result,
                        students are able to see immediately how the moral issues raised in the module are relevant to
                        concrete, socially important applications of the course material. Tight connections between
                        moral issues and technical issues discussed in a course are not always easy to identify, but
                        they go a long way to ensuring student engagement with the module, and also provide natural
                        opportunities for students to practice applying moral reasoning to realistic software
                        engineering problems.

                        The module uses many small-group-based (2-5 student) short active-learning exercises to
                        stimulate student engagement. We have found that such exercises help dramatically in keeping
                        students engaged, and that they work well with classes of all sizes (this module has been taught
                        both to a small class of under 20 students and to a large lecture class of over 60).
