                      “Networks—of social relationships, economic interdependencies, and digital interactions—are
                      critical in shaping our lives. This course introduces models and algorithms that help us
                      understand networks. Fundamental concepts from applied mathematics, microeconomics, and computer
                      science will be presented through the lens of network science, in order to equip students to
                      usefully analyze the “big data” generated by online networks. Applications discussed include the
                      viral spread of ideas, maximizing influence, and the contagion of economic downturns. Concepts and
                      tools covered include game theory, graph theory, data mining, and machine learning.”

                        Module Overview:
                      </strong>
                      In this module, we discuss whether social media companies like Facebook have a moral obligation to
                      suppress the spread of fake news over its network. Students are introduced to contemporary
                      arguments for censoring fake news, as well as classic arguments against censorship of any kind
                      from John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty. Much of the discussion, as well as the follow-up assignment,
                      asks students to brainstorm specific strategies Facebook might use to suppress fake news on its
                      platform, and then evaluate those strategies from a moral perspective.

                        Connection to Course Technical Material:
                      </strong>
                      One thing students learn about in the course is influence cascade models (e.g. independent
                      cascade), which can be used to predict how information and influence will spread through a social
                      network. In one course exercise, students are asked to use such a model to predict whether a
                      hypothetical social media marketing campaign will "go viral." This module follows up on this
                      material, posing moral questions about how social media companies ought to use these tools in
                      designing their software platforms.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-3">
                    <p class="text-muted small">
                      We chose this topic because it allows us to connect material already being discussed in the course
                      (the use of network modeling tools to predict the spread of content on social media platforms)
                      with a contemporary social issue that is likely to resonate with students (the spread of political
                      "fake news" on social media in the lead-up to the 2016 Presidential election). However, many other
                      topics would be suitable for this course, in part because network modeling tools have practical
                      applications in a wide range of domains.

                      The concepts of moral obligation, prohibition, permission, and supererogation are very basic

                      what Facebook is morally obligated to do, and how that question relates to other, related

                      and provides the bulk of the
                      philosophical content for the module. In this chapter, Mill argues that censorship is virtually
                      always morally wrong, as a strict policy against censorship will produce more happiness in the
                      long run than any other policy. In addition to being powerful and highly accessible, Mill’s
                      arguments remain highly influential on contemporary discussions of censorship. Mill does not
                      explicitly address cases of deliberate misinformation in the reading, creating an opportunity for
                      students to interrogate Mill’s ideas as they apply to a contemporary (and for them, novel) problem
                      in computer ethics.

                      on the board. After discussing these suggestions, students vote (via Google poll)
                      on whether Facebook should implement a few of the suggested strategies. The teaching assistant
                      then briefly reviews the results of the poll and asks volunteers to justify their answers.

                        Lessons Learned:

                      Student response to this module has been overwhelmingly positive both times it was taught (spring
                      and fall 2017). A few lessons stand out.

                      <li>
                        The topic of the module directly connects a social issue familiar to the students from recent
                        news coverage (the spread of fake news on social media platforms in the leadup to the 2016 U.S.
                        Presidential election) with specific technical material taught in the course (using network
                        modeling tools to predict the spread of content on social media platforms). As a result,
                        students are able to see immediately how the moral issues raised in the module were relevant to
                        concrete, socially important applications of the course material. Tight connections between
                        moral issues and technical issues discussed in a course are not always easy to identify, but
                        they go a long way to ensuring student engagement with the module, and also provide natural
                        opportunities for students to practice applying moral reasoning to realistic software
                        engineering problems.

                        The module uses many small-group-based (2-5 student) short active-learning exercises to
                        stimulate student engagement. We have found that such exercises help dramatically in keeping
                        students engaged, and that they work well with classes of all sizes (this module has been taught
                        both to a small class of under 20 students and to a large lecture class of over 60).
